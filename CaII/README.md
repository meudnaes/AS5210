### Investigating the Ca II line

Using the RH code to investigate Ca II line at 393.366 nm. The notebook `CaII.ipynb` in the [**run_caII**](https://github.com/meudnaes/AST5210/tree/main/CaII/run_caII) directory is a simple exercise which assumes **CRD** and uses defualt line list. The **run_caII** directory is the run directory inside **rh15d** which holds the input and output from the `RH` code.

The [**run_caII_line-list**](https://github.com/meudnaes/AST5210/tree/main/CaII/run_caII_line-list) uses **PRD** and line list.
